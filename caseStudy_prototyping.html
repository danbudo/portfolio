<header class="introduction">
  <p>In 2018 BDO introduced the concept of “Mode 2” to the IT department. This was on the reccomendation of Gartner who forsee that forward thinking, experimental work will also yield reward. This was realised through the hire of a team of business relationship managers, a solution designer, and an agile project manager, all reporting to a newly appointed head of innovation.</p>

<p>The development team was seconded to this function with the purpose of assisting the creation of digital products that would increase productivity and profits output across the business.</p>

<p>My role broadened to include the generation of prototypes to test ideas out amongst ourselves and against business requirements or expectation.</p>
