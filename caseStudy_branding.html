<header class="introduction">
  <p>BDO employs a “buy-not-build” strategy, and while this does not always form part of the solution , it is has not been uncommon that a project may be built on a third party platform - and subsequently require heavy customisation, or has required several different systems to be integrated to achieve the function desired.</p>
  <p>One of the challenges of my role has been to create a seamless illusion of continuity between the different technologies, to introduce brand integrity, and to establish a familiar and cohesive user experience across our internal digital estate.</p>

  <section class="overview">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>We extensively use Microsoft products, and have been using Sharepoint since 2007. The current incarnation of our corporate intranet, known as insite, was built on this platform.</p>
    <p>We have used sharepoint 2007 and 2010 at BDO. Neither versions of the platform confirmed to the web standards of the time, nor were they of sufficient aesthetic quality to be used “out of the box”. The platform did however, provide an adequate content management system and publishing capabilities</p>

  <section class="challenges">
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The underlying task was to migrate intranet content from the existing Domino databases onto the new Sharepoint 2010 platform</p>
    <p>My primary challenge was to customise the product to meet the standard that a user would expect from a modern website, to ensure that the BDO brand guidelines are implemented, and - once made live - to provide a means to ensure the quality of finish could be maintained in the absence of a designer on the intranet team.</p>
    <p>Secondary to this, we knew we would need to customise the back-end system to make this possible</p>
  </section>
  <section class="solution">
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>The conclusion was to employ a minimalist, reductive approach and to reduce the number of available options for content editors. </p>
    <p>In design terms - for the user interface, we introduced the concept of a grid, and we designed this against the baseline of the smallest screen that BDO support. We defined a single unit of scale against which all elements were proportionately measured, and we created a small, and strict scheme of templates that would be available for the different types of content.</p>

      <figcaption>Examples</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>From an editors perspective, we customised the CMS UI to introduce  similar experience to that of the non -editor, and we took control of the rich text editor in order to limit the available fonts, colours, definitions and relative sizing of elements that a content editor would have access to when creating pages.  We also enforced the sizing of images on publishing pages to 25%, 50% or 100% to help avoid erratic layouts.</p>

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The redesign has been in place for five years and has proved robust against industry trends and increases in monitor resolution.</p>
    <p>The business is currently investigating a migration to sharepoint online (Microsoft’s cloud solution) and on initial review, many of the qualities that were felt obliged to introduce ourselves are now in place as standard. Branded colour scheme, corporate logo, and typeface can be linked or uploaded to the platform with no need to override any core files from the back-end. As such, It is unlikely that such such an extensive rework will be necessary on the next upgrade.</p>
