<header class="introduction">
  <p>In early 2018 BDO introduced the Gertner led concept of “Mode 2” to the IT department. This bimodal evolution was realised through the hire of a team of business relationship managers, a solution designer, and an agile project manager. The new staff were to report to a newly appointed head of innovation.</p>

<p>The development team was seconded to this function with the purpose of assisting the creation of digital products that would increase productivity and profits output across the business.</p>

<p>My role broadened to include the generation of prototypes to test ideas out amongst ourselves, and against business requirements or expectation.</p>
