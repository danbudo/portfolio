<header class="introduction">
  <p>My role and BDO is multi-disciplinary as I work across the entire lifecycle for all digital products that the developent team work on. This stems from rough sketches through to the final build.</p>
	<p>The department has four C# developers and a designer. My Front end skills are focussed on HTML and CSS, but I also have experience in Sharepoint, Powerapps, and more recently, React.</p>

    <p>Decs Online is a legal obligation for the staff at BDO to ensure that the firm is taking its ethical obligations seriously.</p>
	  <p>The previous system had been in place for more than 10 years and was outdated on many levels. We were engeaged to bring up-to-date and provide a superior means by which an editor can manage the questions and any exceptiosn that may arise when a staff member is using the system</p>
